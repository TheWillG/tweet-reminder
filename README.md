# Pre-reqs
To build and run this app locally you will need node:
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Getting started
Install dependencies
```
cd <project_name>
npm i
```
Build and run the project
```
npm run build
npm start
```
Or, if you're using VS Code, you can use `cmd + shift + b` to run the default build task (which is mapped to `npm run build`), and then you can use the command palette (`cmd + shift + p`) and select `Tasks: Run Task` > `npm: start` to run `npm start` for you.
